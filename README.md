# Number-Guessing-Game

A simple command-line interface number guessing game made in Python.

# Description

In this game, a computer selects a random number between 1 and 100 and your goal is to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
You can choose between two difficulty levels:
- Easy: 10 attempts
- Hard: 5 attempts
After each guess, you'll get a hint whether your guess is *too high* or *too low*. The game continues until you either guess the correct number or run out of lives.
